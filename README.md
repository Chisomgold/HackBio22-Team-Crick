# HackBio22 Genomics Workshop
## Team-Crick
A one-month intensive genomics workshop covering the basics of Bash scripting to its application in biological analysis. It had 5 stages.

## Stage Zero - Introduction to Born Again Shell (BASh) Scripting

In this stage, I got a refresher on assigning values to variables, using common commands like `grep` for pattern matching, `wget` for interacting with web-based files,
and `mkdir` for creating new directories.  
I also learnt something fun - using `figlet` for graphical representation.  
The deliverables for stage zero are both files named crick.  
`crick.sh` is the first script written for the tasks (all the code lines didn't run well).  
`Crick(1).sh` runs smoothly - (result of troubleshooting and teamwork).  
## Stage One - Working with biological data and packages. 
This stage was about genome sequence analysis.  
Software packages introduced include `fastqc` for quality control, `fastp` for trimming adapter sequences, `mulitiqc` for compiling quality control reports, `samtools`, 
`cutadapt`, and others.  
There was also an introduction to the conda environment. The deliverables for this stage are `fastp.sh` and `stageoneanalysis.sh`.
